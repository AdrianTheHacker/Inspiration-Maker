### Intentions behind the project

This project is mainly just to learn how pillow (a python library used for image processing) works and to practice using api's.

### Core functionality

- Grab quotes from https://programming-quotes-api.herokuapp.com/index.html
- Grab images from https://www.pexels.com/api/
- Add the quote onto the image

### Tools
##### Languages
> 1. Python 
    - Python will be used for all backend functionality.

> 2. JS
    - After completing the core functionality, I'll try to add a frontend using react.

##### External Libraries / Frameworks used
> 1. Requests
    - This is a Python library for making API requests.
    - This will be used to grab the images and quotes.

> 2. Pillow
    - This is a Python library used for image processing.
    - This will be used to add the quotes to the images.

> 3. React
    - React is a JS frontend framework typically used for web development.
    - This maybe used later when I want to add a frontend.
